    "- **On the homework, I had trouble the the early stopping rounds eval set. When doing the early stopping rounds do we need to preprocess the data before the pipeline or is there a way to still do it all together in the pipeline?**\n",
    "    - You should still be able to use pipelines. GridSearchCV might not work when you use early stopping with XGB but you can just manually loop through the parameter grid using sklearn's ParameterGrid.\n",
    "- **For our project, are we supposed to do global/local feature importance metrics for all ml models or just the best model?**\n",
    "    - You want to understand the model you'll deploy so it would be best to focus on the best model\n",
    "- **Many features in my final project are lag features as I am working with a time series dataset, this means they are highly correlated with one another. However, I feel it's important for improving the model's predictive power. Is it problematic to have many highly correlated features like this? Should I be selecting just 1 lag for each climate feature rather than multiple different lag features?**\n",
    "    - As long as the absolute value correlation coefficient is not really close to 1 (meaning above 0.95 or so), you should be fine using multiple lag features.\n",
    "    - Lagged features in time series data are often strongly correlated with the target variable."

    "# A note on imbalanced datasets\n",

    "    - fraud detection\n",
    "    - sick or not sick (usually by far most people are not sick)\n",
    "- we learnt to not use a metric that relies on the True Negatives in the confusion matrix\n",

    "- most (but not all) classification algorithms we covered have a parameter called `class_weight` which allows you to assign more weight to the class 1 point\n",
    "    - a misclassified class 1 point will contribute more to the cost function than a misclassified class 0 point\n",
    "    - read the manual on `class_weight` because the different algorithms have slightly different definitions for this parameter\n",
